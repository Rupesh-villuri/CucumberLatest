tags="@Smoke"
will execute test cases with @smoke tag

we can also run test cases with both smoke and regression tags with
tags="@Regression or @smoke"

we can apply tag at feature level also.
i added @All at feature level , all the methods will inherit this all tag
automatically it will be added to all methods in feature file

To run from maven command 
cmd-change directory 
mvn test -it will pick all the test runners.
it will work as tags defined in runner file in cucumber options

if not specified , we can do from cmd also with cucumber 6
if cucumber 4 we need to use cucumber options
in cucumber 6 we use cucumber.filter

mvn test -Cucumber.filter.tags="@smoke or @Regression"

if we want to execute with test cases having both regression and smoke tags

tags="@Regression and @smoke"

we can also tag our user story id to the method

@US-121



Background : (As per cucumber official Doc)
Occasionally you will find yourself repeating the same Given steps in all of the scenarios in a feature.
since it is repeated in every scenario , this is an indication that those steps are not essential to describe the scenarios ;
they are incidental details, you can move such given steps to the background by grouping them under a background section.

A background allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it.it can contain one or more given steps,
which are run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks.

A Background is placed before the first scenario/Example ,at the same level of indentation.
 
 
Cucumber Hooks :
these are not part of feature file
can be written in step definition class
or can be written in seperate configuration class
Hooks are setup and Teardown methods just like in TestNG/Junit

hooks are annotated with
 @Before - will be executed before each scenario
 @After - will be executed after each scenario
 
 @BeforeStep - will be executed before each step
 @AfterStep  - will be executed after each step
 
 can have multiple @Before or @After methods , but need to specify order
 
 we can also annotate tags with hooks
 @Before ("@Smoke") - this before will run before the scenarios which are tagged with smoke only
 we can also specify with scenario object to identify for which method its running now.
